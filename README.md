```

### 3. Install dependencies
Install the required dependencies via pip.
```bash

## Setup
Before running the application, you need to set up the .env file, which stores sensitive API keys and other configuration settings.
### 1. Create .env file
In the root directory of the project, create a file named .env.
### 2. Configure .env File
Populate the .env file with the following environment variables:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY = your_api_key
ENVIRONMENT = development
GROQ_API_KEY = your_api_key
```

## Running the project
Once you have installed the dependencies and set up your .env file, you can run the project.
### 1. Start the Application
